# IBM Edunet Internship Project: Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

This repository contains my project work completed for the **IBM Edunet Internship** under the Mechanical Engineering (Machine Learning) domain.

## Project Description

The goal of this internship project is to develop an AI model that predicts potential failures in industrial machines before they happen. By using IBM watsonx.ai Studio and real-world sensor data, the project shows how AI can help prevent machine breakdowns and reduce maintenance costs.

## What’s Inside This Repo

- **Project Overview**  
  Quick summary of the problem and solution.

- **Kaggle Dataset Used**  
  Real sensor data from: [Predictive Maintenance Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machinepredictive-maintenance-classification)

- **IBM watsonx.ai Studio Project Files**  
  All main work—data upload, model building, and model deployment—was done within IBM watsonx.ai Studio in the cloud.

## How This Project Was Done

1. **Uploaded Data:** Sensor data was uploaded to IBM watsonx.ai Studio.
2. **Model Building with AutoAI:**  
   - Data was cleaned and analyzed automatically.
   - Multiple models were trained and compared.
   - The best model was selected.
3. **Model Deployment:**  
   The model was deployed to IBM Cloud for real-time predictions.
4. **Results:**  
   The deployed model can now predict and warn about different machine failures in advance.

## Why This Project Matters

This project, made as part of the IBM Edunet Internship, demonstrates practical use of AI in industrial maintenance—helping reduce downtime and costs for real-world machines.
